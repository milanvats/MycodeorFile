# Simple Calculator in Java

## Overview
This is a simple calculator application built using Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Graphical user interface with buttons for digits (0-9) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
- A display (TextField) to show user input and results.
- Functional clear (C) button to reset the calculator.
- Equals (=) button to compute the result of arithmetic operations.
- Supports integer and floating-point arithmetic.
- Dark-themed interface with a red-colored 'C' button.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Copy the source code into a file named `cal.java`.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac cal.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   java com.company.cal
   ```

## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Click on the number buttons to enter values.
3. Click on an operator (+, -, *, /) to specify the operation.
4. Enter another number and press `=` to compute the result.
5. Press `C` to clear the input field and reset calculations.

## Code Structure
- `cal.java`: Contains the main class `cal` which initializes the calculator GUI.
- `cal2.java`: Implements the GUI using Java AWT components and event handling for button actions.

## Future Improvements
- Implement keyboard support for faster input.
- Add more functions like percentage calculation and square root.
- Improve UI design using Swing or JavaFX for a modern look.
